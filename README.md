**icloud-calendarnames**

This is a Ruby script to pull the associated calendar names and URL's from iCloud given a username and password.

Use this script as-is if you wish in your larger projects as per LICENSE.md.  I ask that my name and link to this repo is included in a code comment. It is open source.
